### How Works?

The user can participate of Pools and earn BTC or USDT like on Uniswap

How there's no lunch free, you can lose sats in these scenarios:

- Illiquid asset

- Stop Loss

- Channel Liquidity on Lightning Network

- DLC fail

### Swaps

- Alice create invoice (RGB or LN) for Bob receive USDT

- Bob receive USDT tokens of Alice

- Alice receive BTC of Bob

- DLCs verify price settled and solve 2-of-2 pairs
