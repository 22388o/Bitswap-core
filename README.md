# BitSwap (Core) âš¡

Exchange for RGB assets

### How Works?

-Create token using UTXO

-Sell token

-Buy token

We'll use RGB-20 as base first.

### Feature

We'll use AMM (Automed Market Maker) on Exchange

-Alice create invoice for B

-Bob receive of Alice tokens 

-Alice receive new tokens of swap

We'll use the model as like on [OBD](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/OmniBOLT-06-Automatic-Market-Maker-and-DEX.md)
