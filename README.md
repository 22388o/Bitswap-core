# BitSwap (Core) âš¡

Exchange for RGB assets

### How Works?

The user can create a assets based on UTXO and after buy/sell this asset

### Feature

We'll use AMM (Automed Market Maker) on Exchange

-Alice create invoice for B

-Bob receive of Alice tokens 

-Alice receive new tokens of swap

We use the model as on [OBD](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/OmniBOLT-06-Automatic-Market-Maker-and-DEX.md)
